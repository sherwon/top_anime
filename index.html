                <p class="description">
                    The Case Study of Vanitas (Japanese: ヴァニタスの手記カルテ, Hepburn: Vanitasu no Karute) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Jun Mochizuki. It has been serialized in Square Enix's shōnen manga magazine Monthly Gangan Joker since December 2015. In North America, the manga is published in English by Yen Press.

                    The Case Study of Vanitas is set in 19th century Paris and contains vampire and steampunk thematics. The story focuses on the young Vanitas who possesses the grimoire called The Book of Vanitas and uses it to heal cursed vampires. The vampire Noé Archiviste joins Vanitas in his quest to save cursed vampires. Mochizuki was heavily inspired to write Vanitas following her first visit to France as well as watching a movie about vampires. She aims to surpass her previous work, Pandora Hearts by drawing more appealing fight scenes and focus more on the themes involving hidden identities.
